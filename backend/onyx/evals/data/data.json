        "expected": "Here's the short, forward-looking take on how Chevrolet and Tesla are playing the EV game—and what it sets up for the next 5 years.\n\nStrategy in one line\n\nChevrolet: \"Make EVs normal-priced and widespread.\" Ultium platform across crossovers and trucks, heavy push on affordability (Equinox EV now, Bolt reboot next), plus a pragmatic shift to NACS charging and lower-cost LFP cells later in the decade. \nChevrolet\nGM News\n+1\nReuters\nMotorTrend\n\nTesla: \"Keep scale, monetize software, and stretch into autonomy/AI.\" Core volume stays 3/Y (with refreshes), Supercharger as a moat even amid turbulence, FSD as recurring revenue; 2025's \"Master Plan Part IV\" signals an even bigger bet on autonomy and robots. \nTesla Investor Relations\nTesla\n+2\nTesla\n+2\nAxios\n\nProduct & pricing lanes (2025→2027)\n\nChevrolet\n\nEquinox EV enters the true mass market (from ~$33.6k MSRP; 319-mile FWD EPA est.). This is Chevy's price anchor. \nChevrolet\n\nBlazer EV recovered from a 2023 stop-sale with software fixes and price cuts, re-establishing the mid-market step-up. \nAP News\nCar and Driver\n\nSilverado EV broadens trims and range up to ~492 miles (EPA est.), finally giving GM a serious electric truck ladder. \nGM News\nThe Verge\n\nBolt's return: production slated to begin late 2025 (first deliveries early 2026) on Ultium, with an affordability focus—Chevy's volume play for the next wave. \nTopElectricSUV\nCar and Driver\n\nTesla\n\n3/Y remain the volume engine, with 2025 refresh activity (e.g., Model Y \"Juniper\" variants) to keep demand warm. Q2'25 deliveries: ~384k. \nTesla Investor Relations\nTopElectricSUV\nTechRadar\n\nSupercharger moat continues to matter as others adopt NACS, even after the 2024 layoffs/re-hires drama. \nTesla\nBloomberg.com\n\nRoadmap messaging skews to autonomy/AI and robots (Master Plan IV), which may lift software value but leaves EV product specifics thinner than past plans. \nTesla\nThe Verge\nThe Motley Fool\n\nCharging & standardization\n\nNACS migration: GM/Chevrolet joined the Tesla plug parade—adapters in 2024/2025 and native ports rolling in on new models (including the next Bolt), aligning Chevy buyers with the largest fast-charge network. \nMotorTrend\nGM News\nElectrek\n\nSupercharger network: despite staffing whiplash in 2024, access keeps opening to more brands in 2025, reinforcing Tesla's network effect. \nBloomberg.com\nCar and Driver\nTesla\n\nBatteries & cost curve\n\nChevrolet (Ultium): near-term packs are largely NCMA on Ultium; GM is converting Spring Hill for LFP to cut costs—commercial output expected by late 2027. If that lands, it underwrites Bolt-class pricing at scale. \nReuters\nultiumcell.com\n\nTesla (4680 & mfg): continues vertical-integration bets (cells, cathode, lithium refining) and giga-casting/assembly innovations; official comms point to key production assets coming online in 2025. Software/energy layers are growing, too (9.6 GWh storage deployed in Q2'25). \nTesla\nTesla Investor Relations\n\nSoftware & autonomy economics\n\nChevrolet: conventional ADAS stack; the software story is secondary to hitting mainstream price points and quality/reliability targets (the Blazer EV lesson). \nAP News\n\nTesla: FSD (Supervised) is now a $99/mo subscription, anchoring a recurring-revenue thesis while autonomy remains supervised. \nTesla\n\n5-year outlook (working theory, not prophecy)\n\nChevy's upside: If Equinox EV + next-gen Bolt + LFP hit on time, Chevy becomes the \"default affordable EV\" for U.S. households—especially with NACS access. Risk: GM's mixed signals on an all-EV timeline and prior software hiccups; battery LFP shift doesn't materially help until 2027. \nPolitico\nAP News\nReuters\n\nTesla's upside: Scale + margins from manufacturing, plus software revenue from FSD; network and brand still strong. Risk: product cadence feels thinner as attention pivots to robots/robotaxi; Supercharger expansion velocity post-layoffs; rising competition and delivery softness vs. global leaders. \nTesla\nBloomberg.com\nElectrek\n\nSide-by-side snapshot\n\n| Dimension | Chevrolet | Tesla |\n|-----------|-----------|-------|\n| Core bet | Mass-market pricing + Ultium scale | Scale + software (FSD) + autonomy/AI |\n| Volume pillars (2025–27) | Equinox EV now; Silverado EV trims; Bolt returns 2026 | Model 3/Y (refreshes); selective variants; Cybertruck niche |\n| Entry MSRP signal | Equinox EV from ~$33.6k | Model 3/Y typically higher street price in U.S. (varies with incentives) |\n| Charging | NACS adapters now; native NACS phasing in (incl. next Bolt) | Operates Supercharger; opening to others; still the pace-setter |\n| Battery roadmap | Ultium today; LFP at Spring Hill by ~late 2027 | 4680 ramp + in-house cathode/lithium; manufacturing integration |\n| Recent wobbles | Blazer EV software stop-sale (resolved with updates & price cuts) | Supercharger team layoffs/re-hires; delivery pressure vs. rivals |\n| 5-yr swing factor | Deliver LFP + dealer discipline → win \"affordable EV\" crown | Convert FSD into durable, regulator-blessed autonomy economics |\n\nChevrolet\nGM News\n+1\nTopElectricSUV\nTesla\n+1\nAP News\nCar and Driver\nBloomberg.com\nTesla Investor Relations\n\nWant to stress-test this from a buyer's lens next—e.g., total cost of ownership at 12k vs 18k miles/year or road-trip charging time on a West-coast corridor? That's where these strategies get real."

        "input": "What are the regulations around meeting booths in San Francisco?",
        "expected": "If you're looking to install meeting booths—also known as privacy pods or phone booths—in San Francisco (e.g., in offices, coworking spaces, or other commercial interiors), here's what you need to know:\n\n1. Building Permits & Plan Review Requirements\n\nA building permit is required for installing any booth or pod under the California Building Code (CBC). This applies to all commercial tenant improvements or alterations.\nSF Media API\n\nYou must submit detailed plans for review, including:\n\nTitle page with site plan & building details\n\nFloor plan showing booth location\n\nEgress plan for paths to exits\n\nDisabled access (DA) checklist and details per CBC Chapter 11B\n\nElevations, sections, installation details\n\nManufacturer's cut sheets for pre-manufactured pods\n\nStructural floor information and anchoring details\nSF Media API\n\nThese plans must be stamped and signed by a licensed architect or engineer.\nSF Media API\n\n2. Seismic Anchor & Structural Safety\n\nSan Francisco's seismic risk mandates that all booths must be anchored and secured to prevent movement—complying with ASCE7-16 requirements for non-structural components, and according to manufacturer specs.\nSF Media API\nSF Fire\n\n3. Accessibility (ADA/CBC Chapter 11B)\n\nBooths must comply with accessibility regulations:\n\nIf only one booth (single- or multi-user) is installed, it must be fully accessible.\n\nIf multiple single-user booths, at least one—or 5%—must be fully accessible.\n\nAll multi-user booths must be fully accessible.\n\nIn some cases, an existing accessible room nearby may serve as an equivalent.\nSF Media API\n\n4. Fire Safety: Sprinklers & Alarms\n\nThe San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) requires:\n\nSprinklers inside booths that exceed 4 feet in any dimension, connected to the building's sprinkler system.\n\nBooths under 4 feet per direction may be exempt if:\n\nMade of non-combustible materials,\n\nPositioned at least 4 feet away from other booths or obstructions,\n\nManufacturer's cut sheets verifying compliance are submitted with plans.\nSF Media API\n\nA separate fire permit is required if new sprinkler work is involved.\nSF Media API\n\n5. Fire Alarm & Visual/Audible Signaling\n\nSome booths might be required to integrate visual (strobes) and audible alarms connected to the building's fire alarm system. This is often required for \"private rooms/spaces\" used as booths or focused/quiet rooms. Verify specific requirements with the SFFD plan review team.\nSF Media API\n\n6. Electrical Requirements\n\nIf the booth requires hard-wired electrical or data connections, an electrical trade permit is needed.\n\nHowever, booths may simply plug into existing approved outlets.\n\nExtension cords are not allowed.\nSF Media API\n\n7. Putting It All Together\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) permits can often be issued quickly if the submitted plans meet requirements and can be reviewed in under an hour per station.\nSF Media API\n\nThe overall process is typically routed through both DBI (Department of Building Inspection) and SFFD, combining building and fire plan review. Expect a short processing timeline (often within a couple of days) if everything is in order.\nSan Francisco Standard\nSF Media API\n\nSummary Table\n\n| Requirement | Details |\n|-------------|---------|\n| Building Permit | Required for booth installation and tenant improvements |\n| Architect/Engineer Plans | Multiple detailed drawings, DA checklist, manufacturer specs |\n| Seismic Anchoring | Required per ASCE7-16 and manufacturer guidance |\n| Accessibility (ADA) | 1 booth or 5% must be accessible; all multi-user booths must be |\n| Sprinklers (Fire Safety) | Required in booths over 4′ in any direction, or exempt if small and non-combustible |\n| Alarm Systems | Visual/audible alarms may be required—verify with SFFD |\n| Electrical | Permits needed for hard-wired connections; extension cords prohibited |\n| Permits Timeline | OTC process available; often reviewed quickly by DBI and SFFD |\nWhy These Rules Matter\n\nSeveral San Francisco businesses have discovered that prefab phone booths often require more than \"plug-and-play\" installation—due to seismic safety, fire codes, and accessibility rules. Many booths lack built-in sprinklers or alarms, so the responsibility falls on building operators to ensure they comply—or face permitting challenges.\nSan Francisco Standard\n\nSteps to Proceed Smoothly\n\nEngage with DBI early to understand plan requirements and the OTC permitting process.\n\nHire a licensed architect or engineer to produce compliant drawings and details.\n\nConfirm accessibility measures with Chapter 11B CBC.\n\nCoordinate with SFFD to address sprinklers, alarms, and possible fire-permit needs.\n\nFactor in electrical permitting if fixtures need new wiring.\n\nApply and submit plans; anticipate a streamlined review if everything is complete.\n\nNeed help drafting plans, finding a compliant booth vendor, or contacting city departments? Happy to walk you through the next steps—or share helpful resources."
